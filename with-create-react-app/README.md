# Remirror example with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn test`

Runs the tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Notice that the built-in test runner within Create React App does not support pure ESM packages ([issue link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/12287)). Therefore, we have to install and run [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) separately.

You can find more examples with Jest in this repository.
